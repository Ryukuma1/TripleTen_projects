Objective: Our primary goal in this analysis is to identify the hypothesis that holds the potential to drive increased revenue. Concurrently, we aim to evaluate the performance of our A/B test groups, discerning any statistically significant differences that could guide our decision-making process in selecting the optimal group for maximum impact on sales.

Description of the data
Data used in the first part of the project

    Hypotheses — brief descriptions of the hypotheses
    Reach — user reach, on a scale of one to ten
    Impact — impact on users, on a scale of one to ten
    Confidence — confidence in the hypothesis, on a scale of one to ten
    Effort — the resources required to test a hypothesis, on a scale of one to ten. The higher the Effort value, the more resource-intensive the test.
