Project Objective

The primary objective of this analysis is to identify hypotheses with the potential to drive increased revenue. Concurrently, we aim to evaluate the performance of our A/B test groups, discerning any statistically significant differences that could guide our decision-making process in selecting the optimal group for maximum impact on sales.
Description of the Data
Data Used in the First Part of the Project

        Hypotheses: Brief descriptions of the hypotheses
        Reach: User reach, on a scale of one to ten
        Impact: Impact on users, on a scale of one to ten
        Confidence: Confidence in the hypothesis, on a scale of one to ten
        Effort: The resources required to test a hypothesis, on a scale of one to ten. The higher the Effort value, the more resource-intensive the test.

Data Used in the Second Part of the Project

        transactionId: Order identifier
        visitorId: Identifier of the user who placed the order
        date: Date of the order
        revenue: Revenue from the order
        group: The A/B test group that the user belongs to

        date: Date
        group: A/B test group
        visits: The number of visits on the date specified in the A/B test group specified
