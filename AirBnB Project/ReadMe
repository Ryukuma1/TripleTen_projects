TripleTen Sprint 1 Project - Excel

This is the 1st project completed in the TripleTen Data Analytics program, showcasing proficiency in Google Docs and Excel. The project involved cleaning a database related to Airbnb rentals and making recommendations based on specific questions. The analysis aimed to identify rentals that would be the best investments while highlighting areas to generally avoid. As my inaugural project, I am pleased with the overall outcome.
