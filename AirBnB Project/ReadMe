TripleTen Sprint 1 Project - Excel

This is the 1st project I worked on in the TripleTen Data Analytics program. This project was meant to show off our general google doc/excel skills. In this project we were assigned to clean a database for AirBnB rentals and make recommendations based on the questions to which rentals would be the best investments, and where to generally stay away from. This was my first general project and I was overall happy with how it turned out.
