This was the first project I worked on for using Python. The following were the columns worked on:

Description of columns:

    'userID' — user identifier
    'Track' — track title
    'artist' — artist's name
    'genre'
    'City' — user's city
    'time' — the exact time the track was played
    'Day' — day of the week

In the project, I compared the music preferences of the cities of Springfield and Shelbyville. I looked at real Yandex.Music data to test the hypotheses below and compare user behavior for these two cities.
Hypotheses

    User activity differs depending on the day of the week and from city to city.
    On Monday mornings, Springfield and Shelbyville residents listen to different genres. This is also true for Friday evenings.
    Springfield and Shelbyville listeners have different preferences. In Springfield, they prefer pop, while Shelbyville has more rap fans.
