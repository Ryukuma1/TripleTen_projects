    'Genre'
    'City': User's city
    'Time': The exact time the track was played

Project Scope

The project involved a comparative analysis of music preferences between the cities of Springfield and Shelbyville using real Yandex.Music data. Hypotheses were formulated and tested based on the provided dataset.
Hypotheses:

    User activity varies depending on the day of the week and differs between cities.
    On Monday mornings and Friday evenings, residents of Springfield and Shelbyville exhibit distinct genre preferences.
    Springfield and Shelbyville listeners display different genre preferences, with Springfield favoring pop and Shelbyville having a higher concentration of rap enthusiasts.
